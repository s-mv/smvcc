# smvcc
A subset (for now) of the C compiler. TODO everything, practically.

[Read the docs](./docs/introduction.md) for... docs. They include more than
just documentation, but also my thinking process as well as I've tried to
document it (haha see what I did there).

# TODO
- [ ] Compiler structure
- [ ] Lexer and Preprocessor
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Code generation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Optimizations
