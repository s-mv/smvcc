# smvcc
A subset (for now) of the C compiler.

This documentation is more of a devlog. It documents my thinking process
alongside the compiler's structure, certain development decisions, 
specifications, etc.

Over the course of this project I've decided to be consistent first and _fast_
later on. For instance, my aim isn't to overcomplicate initial steps and make
something that **works**, then build on top of that. The reason I have to note
this down somewhere at all is because I am stubborn, and I forget. :P

TODO, a LOT!

Here are relevant links to other parts of the documentation:
1. [structure](./structure.md)
2. [grammar](./grammar.md)
